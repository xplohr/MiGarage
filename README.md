# MiGarage
MiGarge demo app - iOS Swift

A simple little app that allows the user to get vehicle maintenance information from Edmunds.com and photos from Flickr. The user starts at the "Garage View" and taps the "plus" button to add a new vehicle to their garage.

The app pulls data from Edmunds.com to populate the Make, Model, and Year menus. The user can add a nickname to the vehicle as well as any notes.

Once the user creates an entry, the user would tap on the entry to open the Details screen. The user can then enter odometer readings, photos from Flickr or the device's Camera Roll or device's camera.

Tapping on the Maintenance Calendar button will show upcoming and past maintenance items for the vehicle, as reported by Edmunds.com.
